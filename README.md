# **HONEWPAY**
## **Site Overview**
The Honeypaw website was designed having in mind a veterinary shop that also has a petshop. It is located in Douglas, Cork, and it has 12 years in business. It is located in the Shopping Centre, a big spot in the area and it is focused on Corkians who have pets and need a vet to take their animals to and also to buy food, toys or even let them stay on the hotel while they go on holiday.

## **Planning stage**
### **Target Audiences:**
​
* Users interested in petshops.
* Users interested in veterinarians in Cork.
* Users interested in pets.
​
### **User Stories:**
​
User stories are more what the user wants from the site in terms of features and presentation
​
* As a user, I want to see the subject matter of the page.
* As a user, I want to navigate the page to find what I require quickly and easily.
* As a user, I want to learn more about what the business offers
* As a user, I want to reach out and contact the business
​
### **Site Aims:**
​
This is optional but offers the insight into what the aim of the project are

* To provide an trustworthy veterinarians in Cork with over 10 years in business.
* To inform which type of services Honeypaw offers.
* To inform where the users can find us.
* To offer the user an oppertunity to get in contact.
​
### **Color Scheme:**
​
The objective of the colors of the site was to bring some joy to the user. Pets are always related to happiness, so (#3B3561) was used for the main backgrounds and (#59B3B3) was used for the the text and social media icons.
​
## **Typography**
​
* Throughout the page, there are three fonts used:
  * Rubik - For the logo. It gives a strong image, however, does not seems distant or impersonal.
  * Poppins - For all the other text in the website.
​
* Both fonts were used to complement eachother. They provide clean visuals regardless of the screensize.
* All fonts were sourced from Google fonts, as stated in the credits.
​
## **Current Features Common to all pages**
​
#### *Navigation Bar:*

* The navigation bar is divided in two sections: the logo and the areas of the page
* Each area, when hovered, changes color to provide clarity that it will bring the user to that section
* Due to the conciseness of the website, there was no necessity of changing the structure of the header depending on the screen size.

#### *Services:*

* There are four main services in Honeypaw: veterinary appointments, bath, grooming and the hotel.
* Each one of them has specific working hours.
* When viewed on tablet screens or higher, each service has a hover effect that only shows the days/hours when the mouse hover each one.

#### *Contact Us:*

* The contact us section is divided in two mini-sections: a form and a Google Maps iframe.
* On the form, the users can send their queries about each one of the services provided, or other if it is beyond that. They must provide a valid email and they must fill out the name and textarea to be able to send the message.
* On the iframe it is displayed the location of the Douglas Shopping Centre and right above it there is the typed details.
​
#### *Footer:*

* The footer has the logos for the main social media plataforms: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Youtube, with links that opens new tabs when clicked.

#### *features
​
* This is where you will place all of your features think about each section of the page include a screenshot and a few bullet points on how it's presented and why
​
## **Future-Enhancements**
​
A webpage is a living beast it's going to evolve past the initial stages of release generally, it's always good to discuss where you this the page may go in the future
​
* At the time of making this page i didn't have the understanding to actual send e-mails from the contact form so intergration with email.js to send e-mails would improve the users experience
​
* Due to the subject matter, we have discussed the idea of including a small JS game to engage the user
​
## **Testing Phase**
​
This is the hardest bit of the readme, when we have completed a page we need to discuss testing.
​
Here is a good idea to talk about how and why you have tested with certain tools and validators so here a list of things to talk through
​
* Responsiveness - How do you test this, dev tools? checking on multiple devices?
​
* Functionality - Each feature needs to be tested before something is complete, talk about the process, click each link check each image, does form validation work, if your using javascript or anything else, does it always behave as the user expects
​
* Validators - Here include images from w3c html validator and css jigsaw (jshint for js and pep8 for python) and the results that came from it
​
​
## **Bugs**
​
Two main issues found when the project was being built was in relation to the div with the text above the hero image. Depending on the screen size, diferent styles had to be applied, especially on big screens, where the text would disappear on the background. To fix the issue, another div was added between the other ones to provide shading when on big screens.
​
***
## **Deployment**
I deployed the page on GitHub pages via the following procedure: -
​
1. From the project's [repository](https://github.com/AlexDralur/honeypaw), go to the **Settings** tab.
2. From the left-hand menu, select the **Pages** tab.
3. Under the **Source** section, select the **Main** branch from the drop-down menu and click **Save**.
4. A message will be displayed to indicate a successful deployment to GitHub pages and provide the live link.
