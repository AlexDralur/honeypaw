## **Planning stage**
### **Target Audiences:**
​
This section is a breakdown of the target audience 3 or 4 bullet points so using our example
​
* Users interested in retro gaming 
* Users interested in a safe environment to gather and have fun
* Users interested in activities in the Sheffield area
​
### **User Stories:**
​
User stories are more what the user wants from the site in terms of features and presentation
​
* As a user, I want to see the subject matter of the page.
* As a user, I want to navigate the page to find what I require quickly and easily.
* As a user, I want to learn more about what the business offers
* As a user, I want to reach out and contact the business
​
### **Site Aims:**
​
This is optional but offers the insight into what the aim of the project are
​
* To inform the user on opening times
* To inform the user about what we offer when they are here
* To offer the user an oppertunity to get in contact
​
​
### **Wireframes:**
​
These are optional if you have any drawings or diagrams about how the site is intended to look include them here
​
### **Color Scheme:**
​
Here discuss about the colours you have chosen for the design and the reasoning behind it, make sure to include hash values as well!
​
For the page we decided on a black (#000) and red theme (#a red hash i can't remember one) to hark back to the designs of the Sega megadrive which is symbolic of the retro gaming scene blah blah bull shit goes here
​
## **Typography**
​
Here is a chance to discuss the fonts used and again why, doesn't need to be crazy detail
​
* Throughout the page, there are three fonts used:
  * Oswald - For the title to give it a strong presence.
  * DM sans - For all other headings including the navbar. 
  * Open sans - for all content text.
​
* DM and Open sans were both selected to complement each other and because they have a soft appearance which I thought best suited to the site
* All fonts were sourced from Google fonts, as stated in the credits.
​
## **Current Features Common to all pages**
​
#### *Navigation Bar:*
This is an example of the features section, your going to talk about each section of the page and what it offers for the navbar for example
​
* The user is given links to each section of the page
* Each option is presented in a way that is always obvious and reable
* on smaller screens a hamburger menu is provided to ensure mobile users have an optimal experience
​
#### *features
​
* This is where you will place all of your features think about each section of the page include a screenshot and a few bullet points on how it's presented and why
​
## **Future-Enhancements**
​
A webpage is a living beast it's going to evolve past the initial stages of release generally, it's always good to discuss where you this the page may go in the future
​
* At the time of making this page i didn't have the understanding to actual send e-mails from the contact form so intergration with email.js to send e-mails would improve the users experience
​
* Due to the subject matter, we have discussed the idea of including a small JS game to engage the user
​
## **Testing Phase**
​
This is the hardest bit of the readme, when we have completed a page we need to discuss testing.
​
Here is a good idea to talk about how and why you have tested with certain tools and validators so here a list of things to talk through
​
* Responsiveness - How do you test this, dev tools? checking on multiple devices?
​
* Functionality - Each feature needs to be tested before something is complete, talk about the process, click each link check each image, does form validation work, if your using javascript or anything else, does it always behave as the user expects
​
* Validators - Here include images from w3c html validator and css jigsaw (jshint for js and pep8 for python) and the results that came from it
​
​
## **Bugs**
​
We always have bugs in development, a few bullet points here to talk about bugs you found and how you fixed them, in later projects this will be more detailed
​
* Issue - When on mobile the user had horizontal scroll with items overflowing
* Cause - The images had absolute positioning and caused them to go off screen
* Resolution - Changed the width of the image to stay within the confines of the screen.
​

## **Deployment**
I deployed the page on GitHub pages via the following procedure: -
​
1. From the project's [repository](pageurl), go to the **Settings** tab.
2. From the left-hand menu, select the **Pages** tab.
3. Under the **Source** section, select the **Main** branch from the drop-down menu and click **Save**.
4. A message will be displayed to indicate a successful deployment to GitHub pages and provide the live link.
